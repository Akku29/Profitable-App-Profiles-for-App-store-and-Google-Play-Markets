# Profitable App Profiles for App store and Google Play Markets
 
The aim of this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App store and Google Play markets. Our role in this project is to work as data analyst for a company who build Android and ios mobile apps. We help the team of app developers to make data driven decisions with respect to the apps they build.

Our company only builds apps that are free to download and install and our main source of revenue is the in-app ads. Therefore, Our revenue depends on the number of users who use our app. The goal of this project is to analyze data to figure out what kind of apps attract most users in both markets.

As of September 2018, there were approximately 2 million iOS apps available on the App Store, and 2.1 million Android apps on Google Play.

Collecting data for over four million apps requires a significant amount of time and money, so we'll try to analyze a sample of data instead. To avoid spending resources with collecting new data ourselves, we should first try to see whether we can find any relevant existing data at no cost. Luckily, these are two data sets that seem suitable for our purpose:

[A data set] ( https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) containing data about approximately ten thousand Android apps from Google Play. You can download the data set directly from this link.
[A data set](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) containing data about approximately seven thousand iOS apps from the App Store. You can download the data set directly from this link.

We analyze the above mentioned datasets to recommend a suitable app genre profitable for both App store and Google play market.
